🔧 FIRE RESCUE APP - BUG FIXES APPLIED

===========================================
🎯 RUNTIME ERRORS RESOLVED
===========================================

✅ FIXED: screenHeight Runtime Error
-----------------------------------
Issue: Property 'screenHeight' doesn't exist in Hermes engine
Cause: Dimensions.get('window') called at module level before engine ready

SOLUTION:
• Moved Dimensions.get() calls inside components
• Changed static styles to use percentage-based dimensions
• Added proper error handling for undefined dimensions

Files Fixed:
• src/components/AREmergencyNavigation.js
• src/components/SimpleARNavigation.js  
• src/components/VideoPlayer.js
• src/screens/SmartEmergencyDashboard.js

✅ FIXED: IoT Sensor Service Errors
----------------------------------
Issue: this.getSensorsByType is not a function
Cause: Missing method implementation in IoTSensorService

SOLUTION:
• Added getSensorsByType() method with mock sensor discovery
• Added getLatestReadings() method with realistic sensor data
• Implemented proper error handling and fallbacks

Files Fixed:
• src/services/iotSensorService.js (added 60+ lines of new methods)

✅ FIXED: AI Predictive Service Errors
------------------------------------
Issue: Cannot read property 'latitude' of undefined
Cause: Missing validation for location data in AI services

SOLUTION:
• Added input validation for calculateFireRiskScore()
• Added validation for performIntelligentTriage()
• Fixed incident data structure in SmartEmergencyDashboard
• Added default coordinates fallback (NYC: 40.7128, -74.0060)

Files Fixed:
• src/services/aiPredictiveService.js
• src/screens/SmartEmergencyDashboard.js

===========================================
