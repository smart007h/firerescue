# ðŸš¨ SECURITY BREACH REMEDIATION

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TAKEN:

### 1. Removed .env from Git History
- Used `git filter-branch` to remove `.env` file from entire Git history
- All commits have been rewritten to exclude the `.env` file

### 2. Fixed Hardcoded Credentials
- Replaced hardcoded service keys in `sync_incident_status.js`
- Replaced hardcoded service keys in `src/screens/create_missing_dispatchers.js`
- Created `.env.example` template

### 3. Exposed Credentials Found:
- **Supabase Service Role Keys** (2 different instances)
- **Google Maps API Key**
- **Supabase Project URLs**
- **Supabase Anon Keys**
- **Company Email Passwords** (FireStation102!)
- **Test Dispatcher Accounts** (dispatch.kumasi@gmail.com, dispatch.bolgatanga@gmail.com)

## ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL ACTIONS STILL REQUIRED:

### Rotate ALL Keys Immediately:

1. **Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Go to Settings â†’ API â†’ Generate new anon key
   - Go to Settings â†’ API â†’ Generate new service_role key
   - Update `.env` file with new keys (don't commit!)

2. **Google Cloud Console:**
   - Go to APIs & Services â†’ Credentials
   - Find your Maps API key and regenerate it
   - Update `.env` file with new key

3. **Change All Test Passwords:**
   - Change dispatcher account passwords
   - Update any hardcoded passwords in database scripts

### Force Push Cleaned History:
```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

### Add to .gitignore (already done):
- .env files are now properly ignored
- Database scripts with credentials should be moved to secure location

## FILES STILL CONTAINING SENSITIVE DATA:
- Multiple SQL migration files contain hardcoded emails/passwords
- Test scripts contain real credentials
- Database setup files have exposed authentication data

## RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move all database scripts to a secure server-side location
2. Use environment variables for ALL credentials
3. Implement proper secrets management
4. Set up GitHub secrets scanning alerts
5. Audit all team member access to repositories

## GITHUB SECURITY ALERTS:
GitHub detected these exposed secrets in the recent push. After rotating keys,
the alerts should be resolved, but monitor for any unusual activity.
