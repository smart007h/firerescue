# 🚫 RESOLVED INCIDENT RESTRICTIONS - IMPLEMENTATION

## 📋 **Changes Made:**

### 1. **UserReportHistoryScreen.js** ✅ UPDATED
**What was changed:**
- **Chat Button**: Now disabled for resolved/cancelled incidents
- **Track Button**: Now disabled for resolved/cancelled incidents
- **Visual Feedback**: Buttons show disabled styling (grayed out)
- **User Messages**: Clear alerts explaining why features are unavailable

**Button Logic:**
```javascript
// Chat Button - disabled if resolved/cancelled OR no dispatcher
disabled={!item.dispatcher_id || item.status === 'resolved' || item.status === 'cancelled'}

// Track Button - same logic
disabled={!item.dispatcher_id || item.status === 'resolved' || item.status === 'cancelled'}
```

**User Alerts:**
- "Chat is no longer available for resolved or cancelled incidents. You can only view details."
- "Tracking is no longer available for resolved or cancelled incidents. You can only view details."

### 2. **CivilianTrackingScreen.js** ✅ UPDATED
**What was changed:**
- **handleOpenChat()**: Added check for resolved/cancelled status
- **Chat Button**: Disabled styling and text change for resolved incidents
- **Button Text**: Changes to "Chat Closed" for resolved incidents
- **Disabled Style**: Added grayed out appearance

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Chat button becomes disabled and shows "Chat Closed"
disabled={currentIncident?.status === 'resolved' || currentIncident?.status === 'cancelled'}
```

### 3. **IncidentTrackingScreen.js** ✅ UPDATED  
**What was changed:**
- **Chat Button**: Disabled for resolved/cancelled incidents
- **User Alert**: Clear message about chat unavailability
- **Visual Feedback**: Button opacity reduced when disabled

**Check Added:**
```javascript
// Prevents chat access for resolved incidents
else if (incident?.status === 'resolved' || incident?.status === 'cancelled') {
  Alert.alert('Chat Not Available', 'Chat is no longer available for resolved or cancelled incidents...');
}
```

### 4. **IncidentChatScreen.js** ✅ UPDATED
**What was changed:**
- **Access Control**: Added status check to participant validation  
- **Early Prevention**: Shows "not allowed" message for resolved incidents
- **Message Input**: Already properly disabled through existing isIncidentParticipant logic

**Status Check:**
```javascript
// Blocks access entirely for resolved incidents
if (incident.status === 'resolved' || incident.status === 'cancelled') {
  notAllowedReason = 'This incident has been resolved or cancelled. Chat is no longer available.';
}
```

### 5. **IncidentDetailsScreen.js** ✅ ALREADY CORRECT
**Existing Implementation:**
- `isTrackingAvailable()` - Only allows tracking for pending/in_progress
- `isChatAvailable()` - Only allows chat for active incidents
- No changes needed - already properly restricts resolved incidents

## 🎯 **User Experience:**

### **For Resolved Incidents:**
- ✅ **Details Button**: Still works (civilians can view incident information)
- ❌ **Chat Button**: Disabled with clear message
- ❌ **Track Button**: Disabled with clear message  
- 🎨 **Visual Feedback**: Buttons are grayed out and clearly disabled

### **User Messages:**
- **Clear Communication**: Users understand why features are unavailable
- **Consistent Messaging**: Same messages across all screens
- **Helpful Guidance**: Directs users to use "Details" for information

## 🔍 **Testing Checklist:**

### Test Scenarios:
1. **Create incident** → verify chat/track work normally
2. **Dispatcher resolves incident** → verify restrictions apply immediately
3. **Check UserReportHistoryScreen** → buttons should be disabled
4. **Try CivilianTrackingScreen** → chat should show "Chat Closed"
5. **Attempt IncidentChat access** → should show restriction message
6. **Details button** → should still work normally

### Expected Results:
- 🟢 **Pending/In-Progress**: All features available
- 🔴 **Resolved/Cancelled**: Only details available
- 🎨 **Visual**: Clear disabled state styling
- 💬 **Messages**: Helpful user feedback

## 📱 **Impact:**

### **Security & UX Benefits:**
- **Prevents Confusion**: Users can't try to chat with resolved incidents
- **Clear Status**: Visual and functional feedback about incident state
- **Proper Workflow**: Encourages use of details view for historical information
- **Data Integrity**: Prevents new messages on closed incidents

### **Backward Compatibility:**
- ✅ **Existing incidents**: Work normally
- ✅ **Active incidents**: No change in functionality
- ✅ **Details view**: Still accessible for all incidents
- ✅ **Status updates**: Continue to work properly

## 🚀 **Deployment Ready:**

The changes are:
- **Non-breaking**: Won't affect existing functionality
- **Immediate**: Take effect as soon as incidents are marked resolved
- **Consistent**: Applied across all relevant screens
- **User-friendly**: Clear messaging and visual feedback

All resolved and cancelled incidents now properly restrict chat and tracking access while maintaining full details view capability! 🎉
